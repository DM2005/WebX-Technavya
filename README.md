## 🎯 **Problem Statement**


### **Current Healthcare Crisis in India**

India's healthcare system faces critical challenges that directly impact patient lives:

#### 📈 **Alarming Statistics**
- **1.6 million Indians** died in 2016 due to poor quality care and management *(The Lancet)*
- **75% of cancer deaths** at AIIMS Delhi are attributed to long waiting times
- **10,000+ OPD patients** daily at AIIMS with many turned away

#### 🚨 **Critical Issues**

| Issue | Impact | Consequence |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Excessive Queuing** | 3-8 hours wait time | Patient mortality, delayed treatment |
| **Disease Spread** | Crowded waiting areas | TB, COVID-19, Influenza transmission |
| **Staff Overload** | Unmanaged crowds | Reduced care quality |
| **Manual Processes** | Paper-based systems | Appointment conflicts, confusion |

#### 📰 **Real Cases**
- Mumbai Hospital Staff Dies After 3-Hour Wait
- Man Dies Waiting for Ultrasound at Noida Hospital
- COVID Patient Dies Outside Thane Hospital Waiting for ICU
- Patient Dies After 3-Hour Queue Wait in Kolkata
